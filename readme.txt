Attached to this file there is my game project of PacMan. Hope you enjoy the game :).

I added colors and animation to the game.
The color option is available for your own choosing at the start the game.
Also added a test for boards, if a board is not valid you skip to the next one if you choose our submitted boards.

The game needs to run on ISO C++ 17 standard.
